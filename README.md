This Jupyter notebook serves as a strong foundation for EDA, helping you quickly generate initial insights and guide your deeper analysis. 
This notebook was originally adapted from a [YouTube tutorial on EDA using a roller coaster dataset] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clblk_NwEU8). I’ve since expanded it with new sections and workflows based on recurring needs across my other projects.
